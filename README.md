# Did financial #MegaLeaks impact public opinion?

Events:
- Offshore Leaks: April 2013
- Luxembourg Leaks: 5 November 2014
- Swiss Leaks: February 2015
- Panama Papers: 3 April 2016
- Paradise Papers: 5 November 2017
- FinCEN Papers: 15 August 2020 

Design:
- Surveys where fieldwork spans the date of the leak
- Google Trend results of searches for relevant terms
- Mentions of relevant terms in newspapers (LexisNexis API) and political speeches (Hansard, Congressional Record) [to do]

Results:
- Mixed
- Is it surprising that these events didn't have an impact on public opinion?
